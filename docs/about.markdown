All models are wrong, but some are useful.

The thinking models that have been included here are based on our experience with teaching 
and coaching new ways of working with [Okaloa Flowlab](https://www.okaloa.com) simulations.
We hope that the models collected here are useful to think about how work works,
and how to introduce new ways of working in organizations.
